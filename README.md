# TradeOff

**A console-based cryptocurrency trading game in Java**

TradeOff is a Java application developed as part of our third semester course Software Project Lab I (SWE 4304). It's a simple cryptocurrency trading game where the goal is to earn $3,000,000 in 10 in-game days, starting off with a small loan of $1,000,000.

## Features

-   **Console UI**: Detailed market tables rendered in the terminal as well as bar graphs showing changes in coin prices.

-   **Market Simulation**: Prices evolve using a Geometric Brownian Motion model with configurable volatility and random trend events.
    
-   **Trading Mechanics**: Open Long and Short positions with multiple leverage options (2x, 5x, 10x, 25x, 50x, or no leverage).
    
-   **Portfolio Management**: Track balance, open and close positions, realize your gains and losses.
    
-   **Random Events**: Price alerts and volatility surges simulate news-driven market movements.
    
-   **Insider Trading**: Try your luck at playing the markets to your favor by consulting market insiders, lest you get caught by the law.
    
-  **Multiple Endings**: Depending on the playerâ€™s final balance, different endings will play out.
